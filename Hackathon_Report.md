## Abstract
An energy-efficient design of every computing tool is the need of the hour, and a full adder is an elementary part of almost every computing tool. In this work a 1-bit full adder is implemented using an hybrid approach for energy-efficient applications. The presented design provides a full swing output and consumes low power as compared to conventional design. The design, simulation and performance analysis of the presented full adder design is carried-out using Synopsys custom compiler tool in 28nm process node. The reduction observed by the presented 1-bit full adder cell in terms of power, delay, and power-delay product(PDP) is found to be about 9%, 27.4%, and 34% as compared to conventional design.

## Introduction
There is an explosive rise in demands of power-efficient electronic gadgets due to the increase in dependency on computing tools like cellular phones, smartwatches, fitness bands, etc. The VLSI design engineers are finding more and more ways to a circuit energy-efficient for the best utilization of these devices. But, it is a very hard task in lower technology nodes.
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is responsible for every arithmetic operation performed by the chip, and one of the fundamental components of almost every arithmetic circuit like subtractor, multiplier, divider, is a full adder [1,2]. Therefore, improving the performance of a full adder cell at the primary stage effectively improves the overall system performance. Power-delay product (PDP) is considered as a fairer performance metric as it shows the energy consumed by the circuit. 
Various logic styles are available to downscale the total power and area of a full adder circuit [3,4]. Thus, it is very crucial to select a proper logic style. Here, hybrid logic style is employed to design the full adder cell. In the presented design, a hybrid logic style is used. In hybrid style various logic styles are exploited to improve the performance of the entire full adder circuit.

## Design of the presented 1-bit hybrid full adder
The presented 1-bit full adder cell is divided into three different modules for the separate analysis, performance enhancement, and testing of each module [5], as shown in Fig. 1.

**Fig. 1 Modules in a full adder cell**

### Module-I 
This module consists of XOR and XNOR circuits that generates simultaneous XOR and XNOR signals to control the operation of the other two modules and minimize the glitches in the output.
### Module-II
The *Sum* is generated by Module-II. This module uses four transistors for *Sum* generation, out of which two are for restoring the degraded signal and assure full swing output. 
### Module-III
The *Carry* output or *Cout* is generated by Module-III. Here, the use of transmission-gates ensures low delay in the output. Also, fast operation of Module-I helps in fast switching of the transmission gates.

**Fig. 2 Reference schematic of the presented full adder cell**

Fig. 2 shows the schematic of the full adder circuit. Each module is designed for performance optimization of the whole full adder circuit. In addition, there is a reduction in internal power dissipating nodes due to less transistor count [6]. The circuit is expected to provide full swing output in 28nm, as shown in Fig. 3.
