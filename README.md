## Abstract
An energy-efficient design of every computing tool is the need of the hour, and a full adder is an elementary part of almost every computing tool. In this work a 1-bit full adder is implemented using an hybrid approach for energy-efficient applications. The presented design provides a full swing output and consumes low power as compared to conventional design. The design, simulation and performance analysis of the presented full adder design is carried-out using Synopsys custom compiler tool in 28nm process node. The reduction observed by the presented 1-bit full adder cell in terms of power, delay, and power-delay product(PDP) is found to be about 9%, 27.4%, and 34% as compared to conventional design.

## Introduction
There is an explosive rise in demands of power-efficient electronic gadgets due to the increase in dependency on computing tools like cellular phones, smartwatches, fitness bands, etc. The VLSI design engineers are finding more and more ways to a circuit energy-efficient for the best utilization of these devices. But, it is a very hard task in lower technology nodes.

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is responsible for every arithmetic operation performed by the chip, and one of the fundamental components of almost every arithmetic circuit like subtractor, multiplier, divider, is a full adder [^1][^2]. Therefore, improving the performance of a full adder cell at the primary stage effectively improves the overall system performance. Power-delay product (PDP) is considered as a fairer performance metric as it shows the energy consumed by the circuit. 

Various logic styles are available to downscale the total power and area of a full adder circuit [^3][^4]. Thus, it is very crucial to select a proper logic style. Here, hybrid logic style is employed to design the full adder cell. In the presented design, a hybrid logic style is used. In hybrid style various logic styles are exploited to improve the performance of the entire full adder circuit.

## Design of the presented 1-bit hybrid full adder
The presented 1-bit full adder cell is divided into three different modules for the separate analysis, performance enhancement, and testing of each module [^5], as shown in Fig. 1.

**Fig. 1 Modules in a full adder cell**

### Module-I 
This module consists of XOR and XNOR circuits that generates simultaneous XOR and XNOR signals to control the operation of the other two modules and minimize the glitches in the output.
### Module-II
The *Sum* is generated by Module-II. This module uses four transistors for *Sum* generation, out of which two are for restoring the degraded signal and assure full swing output. 
### Module-III
The *Carry* output or *Cout* is generated by Module-III. Here, the use of transmission-gates ensures low delay in the output. Also, fast operation of Module-I helps in fast switching of the transmission gates.

**Fig. 2 Reference schematic of the presented 1-bit full adder cell**

Fig. 2 shows the schematic of the full adder circuit. Each module is designed for performance optimization of the whole full adder circuit. In addition, there is a reduction in internal power dissipating nodes due to less transistor count [^6]. XOR and XNOR signals are produced simultaneously whenever inputs *A* and *B* are given to the first module, to avoid glitches and delays in the output. The transistors P1, N1, P2 and N2 are used to implement XOR gate. Whereas, the XNOR gate is implemented using the transistors P3, N3, P4 and N4. The logical conditions are applied to these signals with inputs *A*, *B* and *Cin* to generate *Sum* by Module-II and *Cout* by Module-III. In Module-II the transistors P6 and N6 are operated by the input Cin to provide *Sum* signal and the voltage degradation removed using two level restoring transistors, P5 and N5. For *Carry* generation, switching in Module-III is done by XOR and XNOR signals. Two transmission gates, realized using P7, N7, P8 and N8 generates full swing *Carry* output.

## Simulation and Performance analysis
The design implementation, simulation and performance analysis of the presented full adder cell is done on Synopsys Custom Compiler in 28nm process node, given a voltage supply of 1V. In practical environment the signals in ICs may face distortions. Hence, to provide a practical exposure a simulation testbench is considered to replicate input capacitance and load conditions. Fig. 3 shows the simulation testbench used for the performance analysis.

**Fig. 3 Simulation testbench**

Signals *A*, *B* and *Cin* with different periods are provided as inputs and outputs are observed as *Sum* and *Cout*. The presented full adder is compared with two existing designs, Conventional_FA [^3], and Bhattacharya_FA [^5]. For a fair comparison same simulation testbence and transistor sizing are considered. Here, the unit of power is taken as micro-Watts (Î¼W), delay as pico-seconds (ps), and PDP as atto-Joules (aJ). Fig. 4 shows the implemented schematic of the presented 1-bit full adder cell and Fig. 5 shows the schematic of the Conventional_FA [^3] and Bhattacharya_FA [^5]. The output of the presented full adder cell is found to be full swing as shown in Fig. 6. The circuits are also tested for scaling as 2-bit and 4-bit Ripple-carry adder. Implemented 4-bit Ripple-carry adder with testbench is shown in Fig. 7.

### Power Consumption
The power consumption is the most important parameter for an energy-efficient circuit. In VLSI, the total power consumption of a circuit can be categorized into two parts: dynamic power and static power. The power consumption comparison of the presented full adder cell (Proposed_FA) in various bit orders is depicted in Fig. 8.
![Power_Comparison_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100459963/155859307-48a976bd-3559-4044-9d68-0eb7e520ebf4.png)
:--:
**Fig. 8 Power consumption comparison of the investigated full adder designs**

The total power consumption of the Proposed_FA is less because of its optimized layout design and less transistor count as compared to Conventional_FA [^3]. Low switching activity of the transistors results low power consuming transitions and low load capacitance at the internal nodes. Further, simultaneous switch-off action of not-needed transistors helps in reducing the power.

### Propagation Delay
In higher applications, cascading operations are done on full adders. Thus, the speed performance of the whole system depends on the delay of each full adder circuit. For all of the LOW to HIGH and HIGH and LOW transitions, the delay is observed from half of the input voltage to half of the output voltage. Fig. 9 shows the propagation delay comparison of the presented full adder cell.Here, worst case delay is considered.
![Delay_Comparison_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100459963/155859650-37302b68-07b1-427c-ad07-f7fa64fa466b.png)

**Fig. 9 Propagation delay comparison of the investigated full adder designs**

The effective transistor arrangements in the layout of each module reduces the overall delay of Proposed_FA. Module-I ensures the fast operation of Module-II and Module-III by simultaneous generation of XOR and XNOR signals. The use of transmission gates further reduces the delay.

### PDP
Low PDP means enhanced battery life as the energy consumption of the device will be very low. Hence, the PDP of compact devices need to be low [^4]. Reduction in power and delay contributes to the reduction of PDP, but it is sometimes difficult to find a trade-off between them. The PDP comparison of the investigated full adder circuits is depicted in Fig. 10. 
![PDP_Comparison_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100459963/155860940-e3ae9c1f-6e3c-4a86-860a-ef7a088f8007.png)

**Fig. 9 Power-delay product comparison of the investigated full adder designs**

The PDP of the Proposed_FA is found to be minimum, due to the effective downscaling of power consumption and propagation delay.
